# Google BigQuery + GitHub Archive

The entire GitHub Archive is available as a public dataset on [Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/): the dataset is automatically updated every hour and enables you to run arbitrary SQL-like queries over the entire dataset in seconds - i.e. no need to download or process any data on your own. 

For instructions on how to get started see: www.githubarchive.org/#bigquery
